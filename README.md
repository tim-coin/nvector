# Golang n-vector library - Modified for convex triangle in-point check

This performs approximate and exact geodesic calculations using the concept of
*n-vectors*, as described in

See the above or
[http://www.navlab.net/nvector/](http://www.navlab.net/nvector/) for
documentation on the methods used.

Note that in contrast to the above, this library uses a right-handed orthogonal
*XYZ* earth reference frame with *Z* aligned along the rotation axis, *X*
passing through the Prime Meridian, and *Y* passing though 90‚Å∞E longitude.
